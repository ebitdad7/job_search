# job_search
jobfindr


The module job_searches.py enables you to web scrape job postings from Indeed.com

This requires the package Beautiful Soup and Selenium web driver packages . These can be installed as follows:

$ pip install beautifulsoup4
$ pip install selenium

I also recommend installing the PandasGUI package if you wish you make easy word clouds to further narrow down what to incorporate in a resume.
To use this module, import the job_searches.py file and call the funciton "find_jobs_from()", which takes in several arguments. For an explanation and demonstration of the required arguments, see Demo.ipynb.
